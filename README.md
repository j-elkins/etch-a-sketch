Etch-A-Sketch

Created in November 2021 as an assignment for The Odin Project: Foundations Course.

This project was a fantastic exercise in DOM Manipulation, event listeners, and becoming familiar with CSS grid. I was challenged by the complexity of using different buttons to invoke the same function with different results, and learned a lot about scope and variables. It was also really fun to play around with CSS styling and get creative. This project took 6 hours to complete.
